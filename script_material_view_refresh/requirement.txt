you can look for script style from script_commit_partitions folder
but for this folder, please look into this scenario

i want a table to replace everyday, but client can query without interuption
so i have an idea to create a materialized view that point to the table
when there is the new bulk of data, the table will be truncate, and new data inserted.
after completely inserted, i want to refresh the materialized view.
and given that, the materialized view must completed refresh, so the client can see the new data.
if not completed, the client will see the old data.

this means, when table is truncating or inserting, or materialized view is refreshing,
client can still access old data.

please create these script
- clear and create table (so we can run multiple times easily)
- script that simulate insert bulk of data, so this mean this script will truncate old table and insert new data and refresh materialized view

table should have these column

TABLE  (
  ID            NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  DATA_VALUE    VARCHAR2(200),
  DESCRIPTION   VARCHAR2(500),
  STATUS        VARCHAR2(50),
  CREATED_AT    DATE  <-- the value will be latest time, and will be the same for every bulk of data, so i can check if data is latest when inserted
)
